# Computer Systems Lab: Modeling Timetables of Spacecraft
Calculations needed for determining time and angle of launch for spacecraft to ensure interception of targets like planets are 
complex and inefficient to compute by hand. Modeling algorithms for spacecraft like a Runge-Kutta are usually time-step processes that 
are convenient for computer computation but not human. By programming a Runge-Kutta method and applying it to a spacecraft over a time 
period, a date and angle for a launch can be accurately and efficiently calculated.

Libraries needed to run my program include:
<stdio.h> <stdlib.h> <io.h> <fstream> <iostream> <vector> <string> <cmath>




To install this program, simply paste the source code into any environment with a C++ compiler. Then compile and run it with whatever
tools are given.

When running the program, columns of data will appear in whatever I/O menu your environment has.
